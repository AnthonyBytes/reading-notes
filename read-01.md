# Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
- Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

## Why do we use Markdown?
- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application.
- Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
- Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application.
- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

## What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
- You use the "#" symbol to create a heading.
  
## How many "#" do you need to create the largest heading?
- 1
  
## How many "#" do you need to create the smallest heading?
- 6
  
## When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
- For compatibility, use asterisks to italicize or bold. Use "**" to bold and "*" to italicize. 

## How do you create a link with Markdown?
- To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).
