My Code Fellows reading notes

## **What is growth mindset?** 

It's being open to learning through challenges and failures, and understanding that these will lead to opportunities to grow.

- Understand that it's *supposed to be difficult* and you will *get it eventually*.

- Stay *persistent* and *never give up*.

- Stay *positive* and *do not doubt yourself*.
