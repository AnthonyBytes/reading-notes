My Code Fellows reading notes

What is growth mindset? It's being open to learning through challenges and failures, and understanding that these will lead to opportunities to grow.

- Understand that it's supposed to be difficult and you will get it eventually.

- Stay persistent and never give up.

- Stay positive and do not doubt yourself.
