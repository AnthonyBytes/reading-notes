Reading: 08 - Operators and Loops

**What is an expression in JavaScript?**
An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

**Why would we use a loop in our code?**
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another.  

**When does a for loop stop executing?**
Once the value of the condition becomes false, the loop statement terminates. 

The loop will continue executing as long as the condition remains true. If the condition starts as false, the loop won't execute at all. 

**How many times will a while loop execute?**
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 

If the condition initially evaluates to false, the loop will not execute at all.
