**What is control flow?**
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

**What is a JavaScript function?**
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

**What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function. This can happen:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

**What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?**
when you define a function, the parentheses () are used to enclose the parameters (inputs) that the function accepts. These parameters are essentially variables that the function can use when it's called.
