**What is HTML and why do we use it?**

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. We use HTML to create static web pages. 

**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**
* The opening tag
* The closing tag
* The content

All three of these together are called an element.

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**

When you give an element extra information it is called an attribute. These attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Attributes that set a value always have:
A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

**What is a semantic element?**

Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. In HTML, the semantics help clarify what role the element has in the code. There are roughly 100 semantic elements available. 

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings.

* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page

* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes

* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated

* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
