# Read: 02 - The Coder's Computer

**What are four important features to look for in a text editor?**
1. **Code completion** - Allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
2. **Syntax highlighting** - A feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read. 
3. **A variety of themes** - Themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well. You can also change the theme to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
4. **Selection of extensions** - Extensions are like plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that you wouldn’t have otherwise. A text editor that has a great selection of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality as you need it.

**What do the following commands do?**
- pwd: This displays the full pathname of the current working directory.
- ls: This list the files and directories in the current directory.
- cd: This is used to change the current working directory in the terminal.
- mkdir: This is used to create new directories (folders) in a file system. 
- touch: This is used to create new files in a file system. When you run touch followed by a filename, it will create a new file with that name in the current working directory.

**Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)**
- cd projects: This command telling the system to change the current working directory to a directory named "projects".
- mkdir new-project: This command is creating a new directory with the name "new-project".
- touch new-project/newfile.md: This command is creating a new file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory.
- cd ..: This command is used to navigate up one level in the directory hierarchy. 
- ls projects/new-project: This command will list the contents of the directory named "new-project" which is located inside the "projects" directory.
